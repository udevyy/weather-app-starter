# Weather-App Project for Cod√©dex

This entire repo is a mess, but that is on purpose. There's not much optimization (if any, to be fair) when it comes to structured pushed to the repo, mobile or 2k/4k monitor usage, none of that.<br>
It is simply a little fun project to get weather data from user-input with an okay-ish look.<br>
None of the images have been sorted, except for the icons. None of the images have been truly optimized to be as performant as possible.<br><br>
